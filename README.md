#### The Goal: 
> To create a material design themed Game Launcher with multiple view types to display the games. The user can add all of their games and launch them from one central location. Supports .exe and .lnk (shortcuts). 
This isn't designed to be a competitor to steam, or any other game launcher. I just struggled to find a material designed themed launcher that was customisable for me.

#### Current features: 
- Add, Edit, and Delete your games to the program and view them in 3 different ways
- Customise genres to your liking and categorise games *your* way
- Filter by title or genre
- Switch the theme to a dark theme
- Changing primary/accent colour from settings menu
- Built in browser to find images for each of the views and download them easier
- Scan the computer for games and semi-automate adding them

#### Planned updates:
- Possibly a category view if it's feasible
